“My favorite one in Morrowind is, if you’re running low on memory,
you can reboot the original Xbox and the user can’t tell.
You can throw, like, a screen up. When Morrowind loads sometimes,
you get a very long load. That’s us rebooting the Xbox.” - Todd Howard


^^ If all fails, we could unironically do this,
but at the same time, this could be very dumb so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
